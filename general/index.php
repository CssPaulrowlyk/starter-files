        <h5>[h5, .epsilon] Heading 5</h5>

        <p>To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with natureâ€”could one dream of anything more?</p>
      
        <h6>[h6, .zeta] Heading 6</h6>

        <p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>

          <li>Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off</li>

          <li>So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above</li>

          <li>So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood</li>

          <li>"Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage</li>

          <li>You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this really cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it</li>

          <li>Therefore I advise you to drink it as soon as possible</li>
